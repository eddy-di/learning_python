# What exactly happens when the for-in loop is called, afterwards an example of the way how it works under the hood
# # # repeater = Repeater('Hello')
# # # iterator = repeater.__iter__()
# # # while True: # this makes an infinite loop
# #     # item = iterator.__next__()
# #     # print(item)
# As you can see, the for-in was just syntactic sugar for a simple while loop:
# It first prepared the repeater object for iteration by calling its __iter__ method. This returned the actual iterator object.
# After that, the loop repeatedly called the iterator objectâ€™s __next__ method to retrieve values from it.

# second option where __iter__ and __next__ is present in one single class
